This website provides power calculation for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and calculates the expected prediction accuracy of polygenic scores constructed by ordinary least square estimate and posterior mean of true effect size under the assmption of point-normal effect size distribution.

This website can help you predict key GWAS outcomes and calculate the minimal sample size needed to detect a desired number of nearly independent SNPs that are significantly associated with the phenotype you are interested under different study designs.
